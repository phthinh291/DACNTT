The "Exchange_Rate_Prediction_Models_Training_Notebook.ipynb" file is the source code of the Model-training notebook
The "Exchange_Rate_Prediction_Demo_Web_Notebook.ipynb" file is the source code of the Demo web notebook

* How to use the program:

[Download and open the desired notebook on Google Colab]

For basic usage, you only need to run the Demo web notebook to try the program, as trained models are available.
- Choose input medthod (Sample data files for the "Upload files" method is avalable in the "Testing Data" folder)
- Input data for prediction and hit the "Execute Prediction" on the demo web (For "Manual Input" option you need to click the "Check Format" button and get approved beforehand)
- Wait for the models to generated predictions and view the outputs of all 5 models at the Output Dataframes

If you wish to see how the Training-model notebook work, execute the notebook
Note that the notebook can take from 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete due to the search of optimal parameters
By the end of the notebook, if there is no change in the result models (chosen parameters) compared to the models available in the "trained_models" folder), nothing will be updated.
